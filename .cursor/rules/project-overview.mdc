This is a Chrome Extension designed to display the IP addresstly active website tab. It uses external DNS-over-HTTPS services (Google DNS or Cloudflare DNS) the domain name.

## Key Files:

Specifies host permissions needed for DNS lookupup UI:** `index.he HTML file for the browser action popup window that appears when the extension icon is clicked. Displays the IP address.
*   **Popup Logic:** `app.js` - JavaScript handling the logic for the popup (`index.html`). Likely fetches the current tab's URL and communicates with the background script to get the IP.
*   **Background Logic:** `background.js` - The service worker script. Handles requests from the popup, performs the actual DNS lookups using `fetch` to Google or Cloudflare DNS APIs, and potentially caches results.
*   **Options UI:** `options.html` - The HTML file for the extension's options page, likely allowing users to configure settings (e.g., choose the DNS provider).
*   **Options Logic:** `options.js` - JavaScript handling the logic and saving preferences for the options page (`options.html`).
*   **Icon:** `icon.png` - The 48x48 pixel icon used for the extension in the browser toolbar and management pages.
*   **Ignore File:** `.gitignore` - Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore (e.g., IDE configuration, OS files).
